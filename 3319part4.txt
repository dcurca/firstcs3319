-- the rows where specialty is surgeon did not delete because this there is a foreign key constraint that does not allow us to delete this query of doctors this is because 
-- since hospital and doctor have a partial and a total participation side there always must be a head for that hospital when we try to delete all surgeons there is a surgeon 
-- that is a head of a hospital because of that we cannot delete all surgeons also every hospital MUST (total participation) have a head doctor so that is why we cannot delete all surgeons
